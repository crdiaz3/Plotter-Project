1. USAGE
---------------
This Plotter program is a simple graphing utility with some additional
calculus abilities. 

# Plot
To plot a function, write it inside one of the "Displayed
Function" boxes.  Then, press the "Draw" button or hit Enter.  Both functions
will be displayed.  Supported functions are located below in the "ERRORS"
section of the README.

# Derivative
To plot the first function's derivative, click the "Show DF" button.  To
disable the derivative, click the "No DF" button.

# Integral
To calculate the integral of the first function, click the "Integral (y1)"
button to open the integral dialogue box.  Then, chose your limits and the
method of calculation, then hit the "Recalculate" button.

# Coordinate Switching
Press the "Visualization" button and select your preferred coordinate system:
Cartesian 2D, Polar 2D, or Cartesian 3D.  The view will then change.


2. CONFIGURATION
